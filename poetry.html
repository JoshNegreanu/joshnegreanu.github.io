                                    the breaks or cracks or bends or chips.<br>
                                    it’s the wearing of my sole,<br>
                                    specifically the left shoe<br>
                                    and i’m not sure why but i think it’s because<br>
                                    i like to dismount my bike on the left side,<br>
                                    down to its bone<br>
                                    because i wear the same shoes every day.<br>
                                    because i like wearing them.<br>
                                    because i like them.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    it’s the chip in the wooden chair that swivels<br>
                                    between air,<br>
                                    condensed with warmth<br>
                                    evaporating from the bodies of cafe visitors<br>
                                    who are sharing their life stories with a stranger<br>
                                    who will become like family in the next year,<br>
                                    and a sharp corner wall.<br>
                                    and that wall, too, has a small chip in its paint<br>
                                    as if to have acknowledged the chair<br>
                                    for its many repeated bumps.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    and it’s the statue of the man in the park<br>
                                    with his hand extended out,<br>
                                    eroded to a golden patina<br>
                                    from the heavy traffic of people longing<br>
                                    for human touch. for a hand to hold.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    it’s the path that i always see diverging<br>
                                    from the main trail on this one hike<br>
                                    somewhere on the oregon coast.<br>
                                    and that path leads to the cliff.<br>
                                    but it’s never inviting, and it’s terribly groomed<br>
                                    because truthfully it’s not groomed<br>
                                    because it was never meant to be a trail.<br>
                                    but i followed it anyway.<br>
                                    and the wind fell up the cliff and down<br>
                                    into my lungs.<br>
                                    and i felt alive again. human.<br>

                                    than the first time you witnessed the moon,<br>  
                                    full, and bright in its exposure,<br>  
                                    living amongst the sun<br>  
                                    in the daylit sky?<br>  
                                    a sky blotted with dense clouds,<br>  
                                    overcasting a little town i forgot the name of<br>  
                                    but that i passed by<br>  
                                    on my way to nowhere in particular.<br>

                                    i never knew that something so warm<br>  
                                    as the sun<br>  
                                    could coexist with something so cold<br>  
                                    as the moon.<br>  
                                    and i wouldn’t be surprised<br>
                                    if the moon started melting,<br>
                                    dripping bits of wax<br>
                                    onto the surface of the earth,<br>
                                    just as it does within the reflections of a lake.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    except these, i can touch.<br>
                                    i can reach my hand out, almost grab them,<br>
                                    still warm to the touch.<br>
                                    and as i collect more and more bits,<br>
                                    as the moon slowly dissolves away,<br>
                                    i am left with a celestial body<br>
                                    imprinted on my palm,<br>
                                    and the world is filled<br>

                                    the fall of icarus was a predetermined tragedy.<br>
                                    a boy, spiteful of his father.<br>
                                    a deep longing for the attention of others.<br>
                                    falling from the sky,<br>
                                    that would surely raise heads.<br>

                                    but did it?<br>
                                    no, now poor icarus is dead.<br>
                                    too engrossed in his own tragedy,<br>
                                    he forgot of his mortality,<br>
                                    the one we must all face<br>
                                    head on, through this life.<br>

                                    better to live a life of solitude, reclusion,<br>
                                    and simple stature<br>
                                    than to fall with the purpose of creating a splash<br>
                                    that would eventually be misunderstood as a fish<br>
                                    to the farmers tending their crops<br>
                                    and the shipmen heading to harbor.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    yes, icarus knew of the limits of wax<br>
                                    in the presence of sun, the elixir of life.<br>
                                    a calculated risk, one he took cautiously.<br>
                                    he fell to the sea, as an angel from heaven.<br>
                                    but no one saw an angel.<br>
                                    no one saw icarus.<br>
                                    no one saw anything.<br>

        <div class="body_text">     i painted the roof of my shed a bright red.<br>
                                    and the walls a muted blue.<br>
                                    and the wheat that surrounds the shed<br>
                                    that i work in, that i toil within the confines of,<br>
                                    already paints the hills<br>
                                    that catch my eye through the refracting window pane<br>
                                    a warm, golden yellow.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    could i have left the wood raw?<br>
                                    yes, of course.<br>
                                    exposed to the elements, it would have rusted<br>
                                    to a dull yet natural pigment.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    but who would know that the shed was mine?<br>
                                    besides, i had so much leftover paint<br>
                                    from when i made my kitchen blue<br>
                                    and my bedroom red.<br>
                                    not to mention that my bathroom is green<br>
                                    and my hallway is orange.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    so it only felt fitting to extend the colorful invitation<br>
                                    to my shed.<br>
                                    and while the wood does chip<br>
                                    from the occasional rainstorm,<br>
                                    i can always reapply a thin layer of paint.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    each and every day, i step from the orange hallway<br>
                                    into the yellow sea of wheat,<br>
                                    meander my way over to the shed,<br>
                                    touch the cool blue,<br>
                                    and bask under the hot red above my head.<br>
                                    and wonder what it would be like<br>
                                    to live without color.<br>
